1 | Al-Humaidi Abdullah bin Al-Zubayr told us, he said: Sufyan told us, he said: Yahya bin Saeed Al-Ansari told us, he said: Muhammad bin Ibb told me Rahim Al-Taymi said that he heard Alqamah bin Waqqas Al-Laythi saying: I heard Omar bin Al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, on the pulpit.

Whoever emigrates for this world will be afflicted by Or to a woman to marry, so his migration is to what he migrated to.
2 | Abdullah bin Yusuf told us, he said Malik told us, on the authority of Hisham bin Urwa, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Aisha, the Mother of the Believers - may God be pleased with her - that Al-Harith b. Hisham - may God be pleased with him - asked the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and said, O Messenger of God, how does the revelation come to you? Then the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said, “Sometimes it comes to me like the ringing of a bell - and this is the hardest for me - and then he is separated from me, and I have realized what he said, and “When the angel appears to me as a man and speaks to me, I understand what he says.” Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said, “And I saw him.” The revelation descends upon him on a very cold day, and he is separated from it, and his forehead is dripping with sweat.
3 | Yahya bin Bukayr narrated to us, he said: Al-Layth narrated to us, on the authority of Aqeel, on the authority of Ibn Shihab, on the authority of Urwa bin Al-Zubayr, on the authority of Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, that she She said: The first thing the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, began to receive from revelation was a good vision in sleep. He would not see a vision except It came like the breaking of the morning, then the open air became beloved to him, and he used to be alone in the cave of Hira’ and he would relax there - which is worship - for countless nights before. To go to his family and provide for that, then return to Khadija and provide for someone like her, until the truth came to him while he was in the cave of Hira, so he came He is the king So he said, “Read.” He said, “I am not a reader.” He said, “So he took me and covered me until I was exhausted, then he sent me and said, “Read.” I said, “What is that?” A reader. So he took me and covered me the second time until I was exhausted. Then he sent me and said, “Read.” I said, “I am not a reader.” So he took me and covered me for the third time. Then he sent me and said, “Read in the name of your Lord, who created. Man is from a clot. * Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous.} “So he brought it back The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, was heartbroken, so he went to Khadija bint Khuwaylid, may God be pleased with her, and said, “Give me a hug, give me a hug.” So they hugged him until the terror left him. He said to Khadija and told her the news, “I feared for myself.” Khadija said, “No, by God, God will never disgrace you. You will uphold ties of kinship, carry all, support what is lacking, honor the guest, and help with the family.” Aib al-Haqq. So Khadija set off with him until she brought him Waraqah ibn Nawfal ibn Asad ibn Abd al-Uzza, Khadija’s cousin - and he was A man who converted to Christianity during pre-Islamic times, and he used to write the Hebrew Bible, and he wrote from the Bible in Hebrew what God wished for him to write, and he was an old man. Berra has become blind - so Khadija said to him, “O cousin, listen to your brother’s son.” Waraqah said to him, “O cousin, what do you see?” So the Messenger of God told him May God’s prayers and peace be upon him. He reported what he saw. Waraqah said to him: This is the law that God sent down to Moses, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him. I wish there was a log in it. I wish I were alive when a force expels you. Mecca. Then the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said, “Or are my directors? He said, “Yes, no man has ever come with anything like what you have brought except that you should return to me, and if your day overtakes me, I will give you a decisive victory.” Then he did not break out and It was a pity that he died and the revelations faded away.
4 | Ibn Shihab said, and Abu Salamah bin Abdul Rahman told me that Jabir bin Abdullah Al Ansari said - while he was talking about the period of revelation, He said in his speech: “While I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky, so I looked up and saw the angel who had come to me in Hira.” He was sitting on a throne between the heavens and the earth. I was terrified by him, so I came back and said, “Give me a hug.” Then God Almighty revealed, “O you who bring forth the source, arise and warn.” Because of His saying, “And the distress, then abandon it,” so the revelation became heated and continued.” Abdullah bin Yusuf and Abu Salih followed him. Hilal bin Raddad followed him on the authority of Al-Zuhri. Yunus and Muammar said, “His signs.”

So he moved his lips - so God Almighty revealed {No Move your tongue with it to hasten it. * Indeed, upon Us is its gathering and its reciting.} He said, “Gather it for him in your chest, and you recite it. {So when We have recited it, then follow his Qur’an} He said, “So listen to him and be attentive.” Then it is upon Us to explain it. Then it is upon Us that you recite it. After that, when Gabriel came to him, the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, listened. Then, when Gabriel departed, the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, recited it as he had read it.
6 | Abdan told us, he said Abdullah told us, he said Yunus told us, on the authority of Al-Zuhri, h And Bishr bin Muhammad told us, he said Abdullah told us, he said Yunus and Muammar informed us, on the authority of Al-Zuhri, similar to that. He said: Ubayd Allah ibn Abdullah informed me, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, he said: The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, is the most generous of people, and he was the most generous during Ramadan when Gabriel met him, and he used to meet him every night of Ramadan and the Qur’an would study with him. Now, the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, is more generous with goodness than a blowing wind.
